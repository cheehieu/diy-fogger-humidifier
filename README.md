# diy-fogger-humidifier

I needed a humidifer to maintain the humidity inside my indoor walk-in greenhouse. It was primarily being used as a mushroom fruiting chamber, which required a high relative humidity of 85%+. I found some cheap bedroom humidifer options on Amazon, but they were a bit limited with their tank capacities. Most of the affordable options ranged from 2-6 liters. Since my grow needed such a high humidity, the humidifier would be left on for long periods and require constant water tank refills.

So I opted to build my own fogger humidifier. Key areas of focus for this build were a larger tank capacity (18 liters), affordabilty (~$50), and humidifing performance sufficient to mainting a good distribution of moisture content inside the greenhouse. For reference, this is the [indoor greenhouse](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U9RGVWK/) I used.
